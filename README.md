Joe Cheng answered the original question
I took the angle of simplifying the original code 
Adding interactive plots via ggvis (vega/D3 plots)
Adding additional error handling for incorrect clipping
   boundaries, missing clipping boundaries, making the clip
   values readable (less precision) and a few other tweaks
I also left in the simplified, traditional plot, but commented 
   it out, feel free to try both or the original
